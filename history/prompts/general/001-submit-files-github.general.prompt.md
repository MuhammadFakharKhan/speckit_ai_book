# Submit files to GitHub repository and show repository page

## PROMPT_TEXT

```
Submit all these files in github repository and also show me the page of that repository
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created a comprehensive tasks.md file with steps to submit all project files to the GitHub repository and access the repository page. The tasks are organized in 5 phases:

1. Repository Setup and Verification
2. File Preparation and Staging
3. Commit and Push to GitHub
4. Repository Page Access
5. Validation and Confirmation

Each task follows the required checklist format with Task IDs (T001-T021), parallelization markers [P] where appropriate, and detailed descriptions of the required actions. The tasks include verification steps to ensure successful submission and access to the repository page at https://github.com/MuhammadFakharKhan/speckit_ai_book.
