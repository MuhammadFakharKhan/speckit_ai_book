This module covers NVIDIA Isaac Sim for creating photorealistic simulations and generating synthetic datasets for humanoid robots. Isaac Sim leverages NVIDIA's RTX rendering technology and Universal Scene Description (USD) for advanced robotics simulation.

## Objectives

- Set up Isaac Sim for humanoid robot simulation
- Create photorealistic environments using RTX rendering
- Generate synthetic datasets with domain randomization
- Configure USD scenes for robot training

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA GPU with RTX capabilities
- Isaac Sim installation
- Basic understanding of USD (Universal Scene Description)

## Next Steps

Explore the specific topics in this module to learn about photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, and domain randomization techniques for humanoid robot training.
