# Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation

## Overview

This module covers how to implement navigation systems specifically for humanoid robots using Nav2, including path planning, localization, and navigation concepts that account for bipedal locomotion challenges.

## Objectives

- Configure Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation
- Implement path planning for bipedal robots
- Set up localization for non-wheeled platforms
- Address bipedal-specific navigation challenges

## Prerequisites

- ROS 2 environment with Nav2
- Understanding of humanoid robot kinematics
- Basic navigation concepts
- Robot with bipedal locomotion capabilities

## Next Steps

Explore the specific topics in this module to learn about path planning, localization, and navigation adapted for humanoid robots.
