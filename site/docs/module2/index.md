# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Robotics Simulation Guide, where we explore the concept of digital twins using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for visualization. This module will teach you how to create realistic simulation environments that mirror real-world robotic systems.

## Overview

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that enable testing, validation, and development of robotic applications in a safe, controlled environment. In this module, you'll learn to:

- Set up physics-based simulations using Gazebo Garden
- Integrate simulated sensors (cameras, LIDAR, IMU)
- Connect Unity for advanced visualization
- Control robots through simulation APIs
- Optimize simulation performance

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Create and configure Gazebo simulation environments
2. Simulate various sensor types and validate their data
3. Integrate Unity for enhanced visualization and human-robot interaction
4. Use the simulation API to control robots programmatically
5. Optimize simulation performance for different use cases

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

### Chapter 1: Gazebo Physics Simulation
Learn the fundamentals of physics-based simulation in Gazebo, including:
- Creating world files and configuring physics properties
- Adding robot models and setting up joint control
- Running simulations with realistic physics behavior

### Chapter 2: Simulated Sensors
Explore how to simulate various sensors in Gazebo:
- Camera sensors for visual perception
- LIDAR sensors for distance measurement
- IMU sensors for orientation and acceleration
- Connecting sensors to ROS 2 topics

### Chapter 3: Unity Integration
Discover how to connect Unity to Gazebo simulations:
- Visualizing robot states in Unity
- Creating human-robot interaction interfaces
- Implementing real-time synchronization between systems
